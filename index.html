                Goku has a solid history of defending his friends, going all the way back to "Dragon Ball," where he
                performed kind deeds like resurrecting Upa's dad, Bora. Goku is one of the most powerful and skilled
                martial artists in the universe, with a unique charisma that has turned many former enemies and rivals
                into his friends.
